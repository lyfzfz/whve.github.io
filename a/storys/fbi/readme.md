### 上网注意事项
* 斯诺登同学说过"Because even if you're not doing anything wrong you're being watched and recorded. And the storage capability of these systems increases every year consistently by orders of magnitude to where it's getting to the point where you don't have to have done anything wrong. You simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody even by a wrong call. And then they can use this system to go back in time and scrutinize every decision you've ever made, every friend you've ever discussed something with. And attack you on that basis to sort to derive suspicion from an innocent life and paint anyone in the context of a wrongdoer."
斯诺登同学曾经强调，只要你选择接入互联网，那么你就已经是名透明人了

收心感受
  现在的我,已经寻不到,能为我发出心中话语的句子.
  我想,之后的感受,还是自己去书写.
  自己玩过的历程,注定像历史一般,埋入风尘,等到之后回忆,仅存的只有,当时的感受,或许也有丝对现实的纠结.
  每个人都有一段不愿提及的往事,这对于我来说算吗?可能算吧.当时的我需要这个,现在的我很残缺.这就是我留不下记忆的原因.
